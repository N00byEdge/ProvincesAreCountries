This mod makes so that every owned province at game start date is now an independent country.

This is a self writing mod, it writes itself with a custom script I wrote.

The game requires a lot of processing power when running this many countries. Make sure you have a decently specced PC and/or turn down the graphics.

The mod features are as following:
* Original countries still exist, they only own their capital.
* All other provinces are granted independence, with their previous country's government at duchy level.
* They get their national religion and culture set to the local (province) one.
* The country gets a slitght variation of the original country's color.
* The country is given a random flag. These will change from updates that have changes with tags.

Features not implemented yet:
* Ideas. Some countries spawn with generic national ideas. This is will be a lot of work as the ideas assign themselves to a country, not the other way around.
* All countries: Every country that exist in the game should have their capital at game start even if they don't start with any provinces in the vanilla game. This should showcase a lot more countries that you almost never see in the game.

Unintended features:
* Pink spots: There are some purple countries that randomly start existing. Will look into why these color values are not suppoted and fix the script accordingly.
Other start dates than the default one will not be supported.

The script for generating the mod is open source at:

Place it in EU4 folder, it has to be run on Linux with "./Shatter.py ."
